# Notes-Clone-Application ‚öôÔ∏è

The Note App is a clone of Apple's Note application, developed using Swift and Xcode. It allows users to create, delete, search, and format notes. The application follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern for a clean and maintainable architecture. CoreData is used to persist the created and deleted notes.

## Features

- Create a new note with title and content.
- Delete an existing note.
- Search for existing notes based on title or content.
- Format the text in a note to be bold, italic, or underline.
- Uses CoreData for persistent storage of notes.
- Follows the MVVM design pattern for a structured and scalable architecture.

## Architecture

The Note App follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern for a structured and scalable architecture. Here's a brief overview of each component:

- **Model**: Contains the data structures and logic for notes, including the title, content, and formatting information.
- **View**: Handles the user interface and displays the notes to the user. Provides input fields for creating and editing notes.
- **ViewModel**: Acts as a mediator between the Model and View, providing data and methods for manipulating notes. Handles CoreData interactions for data persistence.
